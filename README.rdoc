== README

This readme is for the Cafe Storefront. I had an issue with this step on the pdf where you call post.user.name. 
I tried doing it on my schema but it didn't work.

My schema was one of a Users table and Items table. Users columns were name, email, password, and level. Items columns
were item_name, amount, price, and user (who ordered the item).
